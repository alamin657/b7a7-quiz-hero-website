    <h1>1.What is the difference between map and forEach,filter and find?</h1>
    <p>Answer:map and forEach === The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value remains different.</p>
    <p>Answer: filter and find === Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer, or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal to something. Both examples have a very frequent use as a developer.
        Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail â€” this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.
